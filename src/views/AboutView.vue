        Professional dog walkers, both individuals and businesses, are paid by dog owners to walk their dogs for them.
        Some dog walkers will take many dogs for a walk at once, while others will only take a single dog.

        Research conducted by the University of Western Australia has suggested that a higher rate of dog walking
        within a community tends to cause more interpersonal relationships within that community. The research suggested
        that people in the community would acknowledge and greet other people in the street, and exchange favors with
        neighbors,
        which could possibly encourage more exercise in the community, by giving pets and owners a chance at a healthier
        lifestyle.
